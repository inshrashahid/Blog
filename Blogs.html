    <h1><i><u>1)Travel Blog</u></i></h1>
<h2> Never Ending Footsteps:-</h2>
<p>Travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things.
     It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also
      to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and
       meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones.Travel gives us our greatest 
       stories, our most cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can
        choose to pay forward to others. It teaches us about ourselves and each other, 
        it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it forces us to refocus on 
        what really matters.<br>

      and leisure. Whether by plane, train, ship or by automobile, traveling is generally a pleasurable experience, at least
       for the people who can financially afford comfortable and safe methods of travel. But it has more benefits than satisfying one’s
        need to make money, like, for example, to see loved ones and enjoy oneself on vacation. There are other benefits of traveling worth
         mentioning and trying out.
